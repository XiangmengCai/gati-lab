 If you are starting a new lab or want an easy (democratized) way to run your lab website - please: Clone this website!

 The Fraser lab website was built by  Since then, it has been improved upon by many members of the lab, and has been updated over 1000 times by James.

 We love our lab website because it is so easy to use and update. Updates are done in markdown, which is very easy to learn. As part of on-boarding, new members add their own bio and picture. This also serves to teach people git and to get comfortable with the idea of modifying, breaking, and fixing the website! The publications page is particularly powerful with easy formatting based on IDs for Pubmed, the Protein Data Bank, BioRxiv etc. Similarly the members page makes it easy to add accounts for Twitter, github, and other services. We keep adding more features. For example, Jen will be adding alumni links for lab websites or LinkedIn pages in the near future!

 In keeping with our lab principles on sharing, we decided from the beginning to share it with a , so that others in the community are able to copy and modify it to make their own lab websites. We're glad they have!
