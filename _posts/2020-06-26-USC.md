I know that the world is quite literally burning, but I want to share some big news today: I will be joining the University of Southern California in Los Angeles as an Assistant Professor (starting Jan 2021) to expand our work on the structural biology of membrane proteins involved in neurobiology. We are hiring at all levels (PostDocs, Lab Manager, etc.), so please reach out!

USC Dornsife is in the process of building a new CryoEM facility (Krios-GIF-K3 + Glacios-Falcon4) with installation early 2021. In parallel, we'll continue our efforts on LCP crystallography. Luxurious core facilities are available for protein expression.

I am particularly grateful that this was made possible despite a hiring freeze at USC. My heart goes out to all of our colleagues who were close to getting a job offer, to then getting the carpet pulled from underneath their feet, either by hiring freezes or visa randomness.
