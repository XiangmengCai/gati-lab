  description: "Cornelius did his PhD in the group of Henry Chapman at the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science at DESY, Germany. The focus of his PhD was the development of the technique of serial crystallography at modern X-ray light sources, namely third generation synchrotrons and X-ray Free-Electron Lasers.
<br/><br/>
  After his PhD he moved on to do a PostDoc in the lab of Sjors Scheres at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, where he learnt everything about single particle cryoEM.
<br/><br/>
  Since 2018 he is an independent group leader at SLAC National lab and the Stanford School of Medicine. His research focuses on the structure determination of important membrane proteins using cryoEM and X-ray crystallography."
