  description: "Cornelius performed his PhD work in the group of Henry Chapman at the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science at DESY, Germany. The focus of his PhD was the development of the technique of serial crystallography at modern X-ray light sources, namely third generation synchrotrons and X-ray Free-Electron Lasers.
<br/><br/>
  After his PhD he moved on to do a PostDoc in the lab of Sjors Scheres at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, where he learnt everything about single particle cryoEM.
<br/><br/>
  Since 2018 he is an independent group leader at SLAC National lab and the Stanford School of Medicine. His research focuses on the structure determination of important membrane proteins using cryoEM and X-ray crystallography."

  description: "Nanda Gowtham Aduri finished his Ph.D. under the supervision of Osman Mirza at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.
  During his Ph.D., he mainly focused on determining the high-resolution 3D structures of Major Facilitator Superfamily Transporters,
  using Cryo-Electron Microscopy (EM). He has also worked with functional characterization of these transporters using fluorescence,
  radiolabeled, and/or label-free uptake assays using LC-MS.
<br/><br/>
Later, he moved on to be a Postdoc in the group of Michael Gajhede at the University of Copenhagen, where he worked with human
histone-modifying enzymes and/or in complex with mono-nucleosomes.
<br/><br/>
Since 2019, he is working as a Postdoc in the Gati lab at SLAC National lab.
His research focuses on the structural and functional characterization of various human solute carriers (SLCâ€™s) using
Cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography."

  <br/><br/>
  After two-years of postdoc training in the Department of Structural Biology at Stanford University School of Medicine, he joined the University of Tsukuba, Japan as an assistant professor in 2019.
  Naoki is currently learning  single-particle cryoEM in the Gati lab at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
  <br/><br/>
  His research interest is to understand the structure and function of proteins associated with redox signaling, metabolic reprogramming,
  and epigenetic regulation."
