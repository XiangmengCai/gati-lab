# Membrane protein structural biology.

<br><br>

Our main focus is the structure determination of important membrane proteins, with a focus on [G protein-coupled receptors](http://www.gpcrdb.org) and solute carriers (SLC). These represent the two largest families of membrane proteins in the human genome and have a broad spectrum of targets for medical treatments.

The two main techniques of our groups are single particle cryoEM and X-ray crystallography. We deploy standard biochemical purification techniques with various expression systems (mainly *P. pastoris* and *Sf9*), followed by a range of different reconstitution techniques:
- detergent based micelles
- SMA copolymer nanodiscs
- conventional (MSP-based) nanodiscs
- liposomes
- Lipidic cubic phase (LCP) crystallization

Besides structure determination, we  complement  our studies with various biochemical and biophysical tools, although most of these are carried out by our various collaborators.

If you are interested in either of those techniques, or would like to collaborate, please reach out to us!
